                            <p>Lake Kaindy is located 280 km from Almaty, in the Kungei Alatau gorge, at an altitude of 1667 m. People call this place the “sunken forest” for its surreal appearance: trunks of giant fir trees rise from the turquoise surface of the lake, like the masts of sunken ships. And “Kaindy” in Kazakh means “birch abundance”, because about five kilometers from the lake, among a dense spruce forest, there is a charming birch grove.</p>
